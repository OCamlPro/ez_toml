{1 Library ez_toml}

This ez_toml library is a small library to read and write files in TOML
format. Compared to the toml library, it supports more features (mixed
arrays for example), fixes a few bugs in the printer, and keeps better
track of options order and comments in file.



The entry point of this library is the module: {!Ez_toml}.
